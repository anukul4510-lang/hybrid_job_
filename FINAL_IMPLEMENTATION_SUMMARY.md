## 🎯 Feature Highlights

### AI Match Scoring Algorithm

**Intelligent Relevancy Calculation:**
```
Match Score = (Skills × 0.4) + (Location × 0.2) + (Experience × 0.3) + (Profile × 0.1)

Scoring Breakdown:
- 90-100%: Perfect match, contact immediately
- 75-89%:  Excellent match, strong candidate
- 60-74%:  Good match, worth considering
- 50-59%:  Decent match, review carefully
- Below 50%: May not be ideal fit
```

### Hiring Pipeline Tracking

**5-Stage Status System:**
1. 🔵 **Shortlisted** - Initial selection
2. 🟣 **Contacted** - Reached out
3. 🟠 **Interviewing** - Active interviews
4. 🟢 **Hired** - Successfully recruited
5. 🔴 **Rejected** - Not moving forward

### Search Examples That Work

```
"Senior Python developer with 5+ years in San Francisco"
→ AI extracts: Skills=[Python, Senior], Location=San Francisco, Experience=5

"Frontend engineer experienced in React and TypeScript"
→ AI extracts: Skills=[React, TypeScript, Frontend], Role=Engineer

"Data scientist in New York with machine learning background"
→ AI extracts: Skills=[Data Science, Machine Learning], Location=New York

"Junior full-stack developer"
→ AI extracts: Skills=[Full-Stack], Experience=0-2 years, Seniority=Junior
```
