## Technology Stack

### Backend (Python)
- **FastAPI**: Modern async web framework
- **MySQL**: Relational database (users, jobs, applications)
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for semantic search
- **Gemini AI**: Natural language processing and embeddings
- **JWT**: Secure authentication
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings

### Frontend (JavaScript)
- **Vanilla ES6**: Modular JavaScript
- **Fetch API**: HTTP client
- **LocalStorage**: Session management
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern responsive UI

## File Count

- **Python Files**: 18 files
- **JavaScript Files**: 5 files  
- **HTML Files**: 4 files
- **Configuration Files**: 6 files
- **Documentation Files**: 4 files

**Total**: 37+ files

## API Endpoints

### Authentication (3)
- POST `/api/auth/register`
- POST `/api/auth/login`
- GET `/api/auth/me`

### Job Seeker (10)
- Profile: create, get, update
- Jobs: browse, search, save
- Applications: create, list
- Skills: list, add, remove
- Recommendations: get AI recommendations

### Recruiter (6)
- Jobs: create, list, get, update, delete
- Applications: view for job, update status

### Admin (3)
- Users: list, update role
- Stats: system statistics

### Search (2)
- Hybrid search
- Recommendations

**Total**: 24 API endpoints

## Database Schema

### Tables (8)
1. `users` - User accounts
2. `user_profiles` - Profile information
3. `skills` - Available skills
4. `user_skills` - User-skill associations
5. `job_postings` - Job listings
6. `job_skills` - Job requirements
7. `applications` - Job applications
8. `saved_jobs` - Saved jobs

### Vector Collections (2)
1. `job_postings` - Job embeddings
2. `resumes` - Resume embeddings

## How to Run

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure environment
# Copy .env.example to .env and update credentials

# 3. Setup MySQL database
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE hybrid_job_system;

# 4. Run backend
python run.py

# 5. Run frontend (Live Server or Python HTTP Server)
python -m http.server 5500

# Visit http://localhost:5500
```

## Features Highlights
