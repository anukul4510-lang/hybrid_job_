## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**shortlisted_candidates table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE shortlisted_candidates (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    recruiter_id INT NOT NULL,
    candidate_id INT NOT NULL,
    job_id INT,
    match_score DECIMAL(5, 2),
    notes TEXT,
    status ENUM('shortlisted', 'contacted', 'interviewing', 'rejected', 'hired'),
    shortlisted_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (recruiter_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (candidate_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (job_id) REFERENCES job_postings(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_shortlist (recruiter_id, candidate_id)

### Match Score Calculation

**Algorithm Breakdown**

```python
def calculate_match_score(candidate: Dict, query_filters: Dict) -> float:
    score = 0.0
    max_score = 0.0
    
    # Skills matching (40% weight)
    if query_filters.get('skills'):
        max_score += 40
        # Calculate % of required skills the candidate has
        matched_skills = count_matching_skills(candidate, query_filters['skills'])
        score += (matched_skills / total_required_skills) * 40
    
    # Location matching (20% weight)
    if query_filters.get('location'):
        max_score += 20
        if location_matches(candidate.location, query_filters['location']):
            score += 20
    
    # Experience matching (30% weight)
    if query_filters.get('min_experience'):
        max_score += 30
        if candidate.years_experience >= query_filters['min_experience']:
            score += 30  # Full points if meets requirement
        else:
            # Partial points if close
            score += (candidate.years_experience / required_experience) * 30
    
    # Profile completeness (10% weight)
    max_score += 10
    if candidate.bio: score += 3
    if candidate.skills: score += 3
    if candidate.resume_url: score += 4
    
    # Normalize to 100%
    return min(100, (score / max_score) * 100)
```

### AI Query Parsing

**Gemini AI Integration**
```python
def parse_search_query_with_ai(query: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Use Gemini AI to parse natural language query into structured filters.
    
    Example:
    Input: "Senior Python developer with 5+ years in San Francisco"
    Output: {
        'skills': ['Python', 'Senior Developer'],
        'location': 'San Francisco',
        'min_experience': 5
    }
    """
    prompt = f"""
    Parse this job candidate search query into structured filters.
    
    Query: {query}
    
    Extract:
    - skills (array)
    - location (string)
    - min_experience (number)
    - role/title (string)
    
    Return as JSON.
    """
    
    response = gemini_model.generate_content(prompt)
    return json.loads(response.text)
```

    const experience = document.getElementById('experience-filter').value;
    
    try {
        const results = await apiClient.searchCandidates(
            query, 
            location || null, 
            experience || null, 
            50
        );
        
        displayCandidates(results.results);
    } catch (error) {

```

### Frontend: Shortlist Candidate
```javascript
async function shortlistCandidate(candidateId, matchScore) {
    const jobId = document.getElementById('job-filter')?.value || null;
    
    try {
        await apiClient.addToShortlist(candidateId, jobId, matchScore, null);
        showSuccess('Candidate added to shortlist!');
    } catch (error) {
        showError('Failed to shortlist: ' + error.message);
    }
}
```

### Backend: Get Shortlist
```python
@router.get("/shortlist")
async def get_my_shortlist(
    status: str = None,
    current_user: TokenData = Depends(get_current_recruiter)
):
    """Get all shortlisted candidates."""
    return get_shortlisted_candidates(current_user.user_id, status)
```
